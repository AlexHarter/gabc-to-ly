#+PROPERTY: header-args python :tangle yes :tangle body_parser.py
- this is a refatoring of the body parser found in main.org
  - I split the file here so I can focus better
  - after this is functional, reincorporate this back into main.org
    - but, still tangle to body_parser.py since it is totally separate from header_parser
      - I also want to compile this using Cython to get better performance

* example input
#+BEGIN_SRC gabc :tangle no

#+END_SRC
* desired output
#+BEGIN_SRC lilypond :tangle no

#+END_SRC
